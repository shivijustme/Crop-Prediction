Abstract— Agriculture is a major contributor to the
Bangladeshi economy. The mainstream Bangladeshi
population depends either explicitly or implicitly on
agriculture for their livelihood. It is, thus, irrefutable
that agriculture plays a vital role in the country. A vast
majority of the Bangladeshi farmers believe in
depending on their intuition to decide which crop to sow
in a particular season. They find comfort in simply
following the ancestral farming patterns and norms
without realizing the fact that crop output is
circumstantial, depending heavily on the present-day
weather and soil conditions. However, a single farmer
cannot be expected to take into account all the
innumerable factors that contribute to crop growth
before reaching a consensus about which one to grow. A
single misguided or imprudent decision by the farmer
can have undesirable ramifications on both himself as
well as the agricultural economy of the region. A
combination of Big Data Analytics and Machine
Learning can effectively help alleviate this issue. In this
paper, we present an intelligent system, called
AgroTech, which intends to assist the Bangladeshi
farmers in making an informed decision about which
crop to grow depending on the sowing season, his farm’s
geographical location, soil characteristics as well as
environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall.

### INTRODUCTION

Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a
country’s economic growth.
In country like Bangladesh, majority of the population is
dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. The amount
of food we need is much less than the food we produce. Our
farmers are still following the traditional farming. They
don’t have enough knowledge about modern farming. Our
team AgroTech has brought up a solution to make our
farmers interested in modern farming. Our web-based
application AgroTech can provide Agricultural Solutions
in a smart and modern way. A simple ML based website
which recommends the best crop to grow. Our main focus
would be helping farmers in growing best crops and
boosting the productivity rate with the help of modern
technologies.


### CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In Bangladesh farmers are the main economic power source.
However, the lacks of appropriate knowledge in deciding which
crops are appropriate for him to grow at different sessions
compel them in producing wrong crops and thus they are
misguided. In this paper we developed a recommendation
system to help farmers in choosing appropriate crops. From the
experimental evaluation, we found that the developed system
can recommend appropriate crops to a satisfactory level.
Although in this paper, we considered the system for upazila
level, the system can be extended to the union level and also to
village level which can provide much better crop
recommendation. Variations in crops can also be considered and
user feedback can be added in further research.
