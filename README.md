# AgroTech

## In this project, I present an intelligent system, called AgroTech, which intends to assist farmers in making an informed decision about which crop to grow depending on the sowing season, his farmâ€™s geographical location, soil characteristics as well as environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall.

## Flowchart of Methodology

I have trained a machine learning classifier using Random Forest algorithm.<br><br><br>

## Novelty

- Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection and suggests the farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters.
- The selection of crops & cropping system plays a major role in improving the productivity and profitability of the farmers. 
- Crop recommendation system helps farmers during this decision making process by considering various parameters such as temperature, rainfall, and seasons and agro-ecological situations.
